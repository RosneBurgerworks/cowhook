# Cowhook

## Leak of Cowhook, dated 15/12/23.

If you wish to boast about your "improvements" and also call other actual talented coders in this community "pasters" while also stealing off said people's code, you should fully expect what is going to come your way.

# How to use bad paste?

# Closing notes
I wouldn't try and strike this repo, as the original source you're forking from is licensed under GNU-GPL and is not your own original code.  
Keep trying to call explowz's fork trash and trying to make PRs removing perfectly working features. The immaturity you show within those PRs are very funny to look at.
